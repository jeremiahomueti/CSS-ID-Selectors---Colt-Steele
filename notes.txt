Another very common Selector is the ID Selector.

An ID can serve, almost as a primary key to an element or section in html, that makes it accessible,
any time we want to style that thing in CSS.


So, among many h1(s), or buttons, we can single out one h1 or button, to style differently from their
counterparts, deploying the power or, advantage of IDs.


Generally, ID names should not have spaces.



So for example:

To style a Sign Up button, where the html is shown below:


<button> Sign Up </button>


We have to include an ID, more less as a hook, or means of access for CSS to interact with the said html element.

Now, so we add an id; we keep the name of the id simple and short, informative and without in-between spaces, i.e.

<button id="signup"> Sign Up </button>


Then, over in our CSS, we use this exact syntax:

#id {
    property: value;
}

Therefore, for our case, we have:

#signup {
    color: orange;
    height: 200px;
}

Remember: or Note: there should be no space between the hash sign (#) and the id, when styling in CSS.


NOT: 
# signup {
    color: orange;
    height: 200px;
}


BUT:
#signup {
    color: orange;
    height: 200px;
}
